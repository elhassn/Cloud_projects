I - Azure - Cloud based file share and sync solution on Azure

Implemented a cloud-based scalable and secure file share and sync solution using Azure services. The solution can be easily scaled up to run in your data center or on a public cloud, with its servers, storage etc. 
completely managed and controlled by your IT team in accordance with a company’s governance and security requirements.

-Skills & Tools Covered:
Virtual Machine Instance
Virtual Network
Network Security Group
MySQL

-Scenario:
According to recent research, 40-75% of employees are using Dropbox to share files inside and outside
of their businesses. Half of those Dropbox users do this even though they know it's against the rules.
More than 40% of businesses have experienced the exposure of confidential information and the
estimated average cost of a data breach equaled $5.5 Million in 2011.
These files, containing sensitive company and customer data, are stored in a public cloud outside of the
businesses' control - possibly even outside of the country. The potential for data leakage and security
breaches is enormous and companies need to stay compliant with their own policies and procedures for
security and governance

services managed by third parties. They will prefer solutions that can be managed and hosted
on servers controlled by them. The same will extend to communication solutions as well.
