I - Azure - Cloud based file share and sync solution on Azure

Implemented a cloud-based scalable and secure file share and sync solution using Azure services. The solution can be easily scaled up to run in your data center or on a public cloud, with its servers, storage etc. 
completely managed and controlled by your IT team in accordance with a company’s governance and security requirements.

Scenario
According to recent research, 40-75% of employees are using Dropbox to share files inside and outside
of their businesses. Half of those Dropbox users do this even though they know it's against the rules.
More than 40% of businesses have experienced the exposure of confidential information and the
estimated average cost of a data breach equaled $5.5 Million in 2011.
These files, containing sensitive company and customer data, are stored in a public cloud outside of the
businesses' control - possibly even outside of the country. The potential for data leakage and security
breaches is enormous and companies need to stay compliant with their own policies and procedures for
security and governance


II - AWS - Deployment on containers on AWS Lambda

Managed Services on AWS and DevOps
Deployed an OCI container image on AWS Lambda to leverage the event driven runtime model and cost saving advantages of AWS Lambda while, taking advantage of the predictability and control offered by a container based development and deployment lifecycle.


III - Team Communication Solution on AWS

Implemented a team communication solution using Mattermost and AWS. This is a scalable solution that can be hosted on a public cloud, with its servers, storage etc. completely managed and controlled by an IT team in accordance with a company’s governance and security requirements.
